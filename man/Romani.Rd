\title{Defacing the palace.}
\description{
In order to stick it to the Romans, Brian is sent on a night mission
of defacing Pilat's palace with defiant graffiti.
He is to paint "Romans go home" on the wall of the palace, for all to see.
}
\details{
Unfortunately, he is caught in the act by a centurion,
who forces him - at swordpoint - to immediately correct the mistakes
in his Latin. You see, rather that the proper "Romani ite domum"
Biran had written "Romanes eunt domus", which,
as the centurion is sure to point out, just means
"The people called Romans, they go, the house" and this just will not do.
Having cleared up the proper declension,
he bids Brian paint the proper slogan on the palace wall
a hundred times before sunrise or he will cut his balls off.

And so he does. But has the lesson stuck?

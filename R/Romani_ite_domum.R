#' Defacing the palace.
#'
#' In order to stick it to the Romans, Brian is sent on a night mission
#' of defacing Pilat's palace with defiant graffiti.
#' He is to paint "Romans go home" on the wall of the palace, for all to see.
#'
#' Unfortunately, he is caught in the act by a centurion,
#' who forces him - at swordpoint - to immediately correct the mistakes
#' in his Latin. You see, rather that the proper "Romani ite domum"
#' Biran had written "Romanes eunt domus", which,
#' as the centurion is sure to point out, just means
#' "The people called Romans, they go, the house" and this just will not do.
#' Having cleared up the proper declension,
#' he bids Brian paint the proper slogan on the palace wall
#' a hundred times before sunrise or he will cut his balls off.
#'
#' And so he does. But has the lesson stuck?

#' This help page will contain homework assignments.
#'
#' If you're stuck, use the \code{hint} function.
#'
#' @section Solutions:
#' As a rule, solutions will not be provided unless I feel the exercises become too difficult or tedious.
#'
#' @section For Part One:
#' The lecture and notes should be sufficient to solve all these problems.
#' When in doubt, feel free to use the help
#' but for the time being refrain from looking on the Internet.
#'
#' Since exersises 8-11 are getting large and difficult, there is a solution provided.
#' Use the \code{solution} function to get a character vector like the one you're suppose to construct.
#' You can then test whether your result is EXACTLY like mine with \code{identical}.
#'
#' \enumerate{
# 1
#'   \item{
#'   Create and a character string describing the current date like 25th February 2020.
#'   }
# 2
#'   \item{
#'   Assign the previous string to a variable and print it in the console.
#'   }
# 3
#'   \item{
#'   Create the same string by combining three separate strings:
#'   one for the day, one for the month, and one for the year.
#'   }
# 4
#'   \item{
#'   Create three vectors that can be used to construct every date in 2000, 2010 and 2020:
#'   one for days (1st through 31st), one for months (January through December), and one for the years.
#'   }
# 5
#'   \item{
#'   Construct all dates in January 2020, each in one separate string.
#'   Have them printed in the console.
#'   }
# 6
#'   \item{
#'   Put all dates constructed above into one vector.
#'   }
# 7
#'   \item{
#'   Repeat the above with all dates in June 2020. Remember, there is no June 31st.
#'   }
# 8
#'   \item{
#'   Repeat the above with all dates in all of the three years. Mind the leap year(s).
#'   }
# 9
#'   \item{
#'   Repeat the above but make it so that the last date is 3rd May 2020.
#'   }
# 10
#'   \item{
#'   Repeat exercise 8 but make it so that state holidays are not included.
#'   }
# 11
#'   \item{
#'   This is a hard one.
#'
#'   Repeat excersize 8 but also add week days: 25th February 2020 Tuesday.
#'   2000 started on a Saturday, 2010 on a Friday, and 2020 - on a Wednesday.
#'
#'   Even though we did cover it, you don't need subsetting to do this, so don't.
#'   }
# 12
#'   \item{
#'   There are probably several objects in your Global Environment. (If not, create some.)
#'   Remove them all with a single console command (two at most).
#'   Try to do it in a way that does not require you to know the contents of GlobalEnv to do it.
#'   }
#' }

# #' @section For Part Two:
# #' Use only base R when solving these problems (no added packages allowed).
# #' \enumerate{
# #'   \item{
# #'   They are attached to every R session and reside in the datasets package.
# #'   Find out which of them are data frames that contain at least two columns that are factors.
# #'   Present the result as a character vector.
# #'   }
# #'   \item{
# #'   Pick 10 rows from the iris data set at random.
# #'   }
# #'   \item{
# #'   Obtain a data frame like Iris, with 5 random irises from every species in the iris data set.
# #'   }
# #' }

# #' @section For Part Three:
# #' \enumerate{
# #'   \item{
# #'   Obtain a data frame with 10 random irises from every species in the iris data set.
# #'   Do it with both \code{dplyr} and \code{data.table}.
# #'   }
# #'   \item{
# #'   compare frequencies of two types of events in two data sets
# #'   }
# #' }
